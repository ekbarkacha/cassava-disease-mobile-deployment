        <h1>Privacy Policy for CassavaCare</h1>
        <p>Effective date: December 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            CassavaCare ("we", "our", "the app") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the app collects, uses, and protects your information.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            CassavaCare processes images of cassava leaves locally on your device for disease detection. No personal data, such as your name, email, or location, is collected or transmitted to any server.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            The information processed by the app is used solely to detect cassava crop diseases and provide remedies. All scan results are stored securely on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Your scan history remains on your device and is not shared externally. We recommend regular backups if you wish to retain your scan data permanently.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The app does not send data to any third-party analytics or tracking services. All processing occurs locally.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate measures to protect your scan data on the device. However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The app is intended for users aged 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
